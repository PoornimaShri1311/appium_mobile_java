# trustWallet-clean

This is a clean and scalable mobile automation framework for Android, enhanced from the original [sample-mobile-framework](https://github.com/HadiTW/sample-mobile-framework).

## ✅ Key Enhancements

This fork includes several improvements for better maintainability, structure, and reporting:

### 🔧 Framework Structure Improvements
- **Added new utilities under `utils/`:**
    - `CapabilitiesManager`: Handles capability setup in a modular way
    - `ExtentManager`: Centralized ExtentReports configuration
    - `PropertyLoader`: Loads properties from config files
    - `ScreenshotUtils`: Captures screenshots during test execution
    - `WaitUtils`: Handles explicit waits across the framework

- **Structured `pages/` folder**: Created new page classes representing different screens and integrated them with utility classes.

### 📦 Build & Dependency Management
- Updated the `pom.xml` to include:
    - Latest **Java client** version for Appium
    - Additional **plugins** and dependencies required for reporting, screenshots, and utility classes

### 🧪 Test Execution Flow
- Updated `BaseTest` class:
    - Added `@BeforeSuite` and `@AfterSuite` for suite-level setup and teardown
    - Enhanced `@AfterMethod` to capture screenshots and log results in ExtentReports

### 📂 Added Support For
- `reports/` – Auto-generated test execution reports
- `logs/` – Organized log files
- `screenshots/` – Failure screenshots for test analysis

> ✅ These folders are excluded from Git using `.gitignore`.

### ⚠️ APK File Note
